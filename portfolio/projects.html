                <!-- Overview -->
                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    For Necrobotics, I served as the Level Designer on an 8-member team. 
                    My primary responsibility was to <strong>design the world and player exploration flow</strong> for this 
                    exploration-driven game. The project featured minimal narrative, so I leaned on using environmental 
                    storytelling and game mechanics to guide players toward the final boss encounter.
                </p>
                
                <img src="assets/images/N/team.png" alt="Necrobotics Team" class="image featured" style="width:50%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;"/>

                <h3>Design Constraints</h3>
                <ul class="centered-list">
                    <li><strong>1</strong> Boss Encounter</li>
                    <li><strong>4</strong> Player Abilities (1 Core + 3 Secondary)</li>
                    <li><strong>3</strong> Sub-Sections / Zones</li>
                    <li><strong>3</strong> Enemy Types</li>
                    <li>Dedicated Rest Areas for Pacing</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Process -->
                <h3>Design Process</h3>
                <p>
                    I began by mapping out player paths to ensure that core abilities were 
                    introduced in a safe, low-risk environment. To encourage exploration, I implemented 
                    soft locks that required players to collect abilities naturally before 
                    reaching the boss room.
                </p>

                <div class="image-pair">
                    <img src="assets/images/N/Key.png" alt="Original Layout" />
                    <img src="assets/images/N/Diagram.jpg" alt="Final Layout" />
                </div>

                <p>
                    I began by creating the first draft layout, combining the individual rooms into a cohesive 
                    flow. My initial focus was on defining entrances and exits to establish how players would 
                    naturally navigate between spaces. From there, I designed the first few rooms to:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Introduce the core controls in a safe, guided environment</li>
                        <li>Gradually present threats and environmental hazards</li>
                        <li>Lead players toward the first challenge through clear, linear level design</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p> The pictures below are screenshots of the first few rooms with notes showing my intentions with it. </p>

                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <button class="prev-btn">Prev</button>
                        <button class="next-btn">Next</button>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Iteration & Modular Design</h3>
                <p> After playtesting the first few rooms, I moved on to design the rest of the rooms. 
                    Here was what the original layout looked like:
                </p>

                <img src="assets/images/N/Original layout.png" alt="Original layout" class="image featured"/>
                <p> To keep the pacing engaging, I mixed intense sections with quieter moments by clustering 
                    enemies in specific areas and leaving other spots mostly empty.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, we were falling behind schedule so we decided to scope down the game. Because I designed the world 
                    with modular rooms and branching paths, I was able to remove rooms without breaking 
                    progression. This ensured the final layout felt cohesive despite reduced content.
                </p>

                <div class="image-pair">
                    <img src="assets/images/N/Original layout.png" alt="Original Layout" />
                    <img src="assets/images/N/Revised Layout.png" alt="Revised Layout" />
                </div>
                <p class="caption">Original blockout (left) vs final scoped layout (right). Below is the final design in Godot.</p>

                <!-- Takeaways -->
                <h3>Design Takeaways</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Player-Centric Design:</strong> Introduced abilities and hazards naturally without forced tutorials.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pacing & Flow:</strong> Balanced combat intensity with quiet exploration spaces.</li>
                    <li><strong>Modular Thinking:</strong> Built rooms to allow scope reduction without breaking progression.</li>
                    <li><strong>Iterative Workflow:</strong> Applied playtesting feedback to adjust layouts and encounters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Gained experience in a Scrum-based, multi-disciplinary team.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Overall, Necrobotics strengthened my ability to 
                    <strong>design exploration-focused levels</strong>, 
                    <strong>iterate quickly</strong>, and 
                    <strong>adapt to production constraints</strong>. I’m eager to apply what I learned in a professional design team.
