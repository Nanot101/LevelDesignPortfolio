                            I led the level design for this month-long project. To ground my designs, my teammate and I quickly outlined the story: 
                            a book-like creature exploring the human world. I focused on creating environments that feel isolated and forgotten, 
                            drawing inspiration from office storage rooms to reflect the creature’s sense of curiosity and vulnerability.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            This reference perfectly captures my vision.
                        </p>
                        <img src="assets/images/TLP/ref2TLP.png" alt="First Level Screenshot" class="image featured"/>
                        <p>
                            I sketched a linear layout to control pacing and introduce mechanics one at a time. By limiting the player to a single 
                            path, I ensured a smooth and guided onboarding experience.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Development Screenshots</h3>
                        <div class="carousel">
                            <img id="carousel-image" src="assets/images/TLP/ref8TLP.png" alt="Development Screenshot" />

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            These sketches show my initial room plans, each labeled and connected to its next space. Since the layout was fixed, I 
                            quickly created simple blockouts to visualize the flow and maintain modularity for easy iteration. I also paced the level 
                            intentionally, giving players time to experiment with each new mechanic before progressing.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Final Design</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the final design, I explored lighting and set dressing while experimenting with scale. Since the playable character is much 
                            smaller than everyday objects, I emphasized that perspective to make the environment feel immersive and playful.

                        <h3>Problem with this level</h3>
                        <p>
                            We couldn’t iterate as much as I hoped, and several rooms were cut due to time, scope, and miscommunication. This experience taught 
                            me the importance of clear communication and realistic planning. By not accounting for our team’s bandwidth (especially with our 
                            programmers as they were busy building the framework), we ended up discarding ideas that were out of scope. It was a valuable lesson 
                            in aligning creativity with project limitations.
                        </p>

                <!-- Second Level Content -->
                <div id="tab2" class="tab-content">

                        <p>
                            The second level shifted to an open-world design with multiple paths. It was my first time approaching this style. Unlike the first 
                            level, its larger scale introduced challenges with object placement and player perspective. To keep the space engaging without 
                            overwhelming the player, I filled open areas with environmental props and limited enemy patrols on the ground. This level taught me 
                            how to balance scale, exploration, and pacing in a more open environment.
                        </p>
                        <img src="assets/images/TLP/ref19TLP.png" alt="Second Level Screenshot" class="image featured"/>
                        <p>
                            The player’s objective in this level was to defeat the boss stationed by the printer. To reach it, they first had to disable a wall 
                            switch located by one of the tables. The level’s flow is highlighted here, with the critical path shown in purple and the golden 
                            path in magenta.

                        <h3>Problems with this level</h3>
                        <p>
                            The main issue with this level wasn’t scale, but direction. After spawning, players had no clear indication of what to do. While open 
                            exploration was intentional, I missed opportunities to guide the player through environmental storytelling or explicit indicators like 
                            signs, cutscenes, or waypoints. I also overlooked how our locked camera (constraint) limited the player’s ability to survey the environment. 
                            This experience taught me the importance of balancing freedom with subtle guidance to keep players oriented.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also missed playtesting smaller sections to better understand the player’s spatial needs. Without testing each area, I overlooked that one 
                            section became too cramped for combat, limiting player movement against multiple enemies. This taught me the value of iterative playtesting 
                            to ensure balanced and enjoyable encounters.

                        <p>
                            Working on these two levels taught me a lot about level design and reinforced my passion for worldbuilding. Looking back, I see clear areas 
                            for improvement, but I’m proud of what I achieved within such a short time. These projects reflect my growth, showing not only my successes 
                            but also mistakes and remind me that learning is an ongoing journey. I’m excited to apply these lessons to future designs and continue honing 
                            my craft.
